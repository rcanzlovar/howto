# how to make cashew/walnut/oat milk

## Nut milks

Any nut or oat milk is super early to make. 

1. Soak desired nuts or oats overnight, this helps get some of the starch off which can make the milk a little 
“slimy”. You can also soak them in hot, not boiling, water if you are short on time. 
2. Drain them and blend them with fresh room temp water. I used a good handful for every nutribullet container. 
There are recipes that have more exact proportions.
3. Strain them through a cheese cloth or nut milk bag.

that’s the ones I bought off am amazon. 2-pack for ~$6. 

That’s it. You can add cinnamon or a sweetener before blending if you want, I prefer it as is. Almond milk is 
great but I feel like the walnuts and cashews blend to make a creamier result. Something closer to half and half.

## oat milk
I take 4 cups of water per 1 cup rolled oats and let them soak for a couple hours (you don’t need to soak them, 
I just find it makes it creamier) and then blend them for like 45 seconds in a blender. From there I use a cheese 
cloth to strain the liquid. And that’s it! You can add a date for sweetness but I don’t like doing that.
