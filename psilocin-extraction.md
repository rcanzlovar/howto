You all sound like you want a complete extraction. Lucky for you, I can help.

Psilocin (and -cybin) don't degrade in boiling water (at least not in a short period of time like Tea requires). You can get more out with hot water faster, as opposed to cold. The heat improves solubility. The major problem with using water alone is that Psilocin isn't as water soluble as the -cybin, so hot tea extractions are probably incomplete, as are water-only extractions.

You'll likely get a better extraction by just letting the mushrooms sit overnight in water, regardless of the starting temperature because you've added the other crucial component for getting an extraction to completeness, which is time. The cleaner the starting water, the better the extraction as well. Ideally at home distilled water (or RO water if you have one of those) will give you the best results.

You can still improve the extraction of the psilocin component by adding some alcohol to your extraction (100 proof vodka, or everclear if you really wanna go hard).

You can also get another improvement to this some by increasing the amount of particle/unit surface area of the components you're trying to extract by grinding them up - the finer, the better.

Lastly, since we're dealing with alkaloids, salting them out with acid is the final improvement. That's what the lemon juice in the Lemon Tek does. So how about we put *all* of that together in one method.



An ideal time-effective, complete extraction would look like this (For up to 5 grams of ground dry fungus, or 30g wet):

Keep in mind, 1 fluid ounce = 30mL if you're outside of the States. If you're on the ball, this can be done in 30 minutes, not including cleaning the kettle beforehand.

Distilled water is ideal, but make sure you get the mineral scale out of your kettle first. (White vinegar works nice for that - then double rinse with distilled)

Set your pot or kettle on heat to boil.

Weigh out mushrooms, and then grind them up. (blender, if they're not dried)

Transfer to a small glass container or jar, and add 1 oz high-proof vodka or everclear. (High proof = 100 or better, don't use anything else besides vodka or everclear)

Once the water boils, add 5-6 ounces of it to the liquor and fungus. (You can do less, but the less you have, the more you need to wait - solubility is king!)

Immediately after adding the water, add 1 ounce of lemon juice. You can use 2 oz of 100% Grapefruit juice if you really want a kick in the pants - Never use "juice cocktail" for extraction.

Let stand for 15-20 minutes. I usually wait until the solution is just warm, not quite tepid. Filter the mushroom bits out with a funnel and a coffee filter. (Unnecessary additional nausea)

If you really want to suck the alkaloids out, use an insulated coffee mug for your extraction vessel. If it holds heat longer, you'll get another incremental improvement in your extraction.

Cheers!
You have 15 min or less to get some place comfortable once you chug your tea.

Oh, and if you're using a blender for fresh fungus, you should just leave the mushrooms in the blender after you pulverize them. You'll add the ounce of alcohol on top before you blend.

You'll rinse the blender out with your hot water in to your extraction vessel in 2 parts. ½ first (3 oz), transfer the liquid, then the other ½ to get the remainder of the bits.

I guess you can use the blender to extract if you want, but be careful if you're using a magic bullet or similar. Might not want to leach the plastic of the blending cup with hot alcohol water. If you have an adapter for a mason jar (Wide-mouth or otherwise), that's gonna be best. Some blenders don't need anything special. Glass is best for clean chemistry!

If you want to skip the lemon juice and let it sit overnight, I'd wager you could just evaporate the water and alcohol in a pyrex dish, and scrape what's left for a rather potent extract.

I'd make some slight modifications for larger batches of fresh mushrooms for making extracts, though. I'd do 2oz alcohol and 6oz water per 30g wet. Blend with alcohol let it sit for an hour (with just the alcohol), and you can read the rest above, leaving out the citrus juice.

After you have the extraction, you can strain into a pyrex dish and set in the oven at about 200oF / 95oC until it's bone dry. Scrape up the resulting solid extract. I'd be interested in how that turns out if you wanted to try.

I'd guess total Psilocin and -cybin (read: active alkaloid) recovery for this method is probably in the 95-99% range. I'd say you're getting 80-85% or so otherwise with just water. Maybe *slightly* more if you add lemon juice alone.

I've never stored it long term. But in general, acidified water is a terrible storage medium. If you were planning on storing it for a while, I'd let the concoction sit overnight instead, skip the lemon juice, and strain and freeze into ice cubes.

Really, you're just better off not preparing anything, and leaving the mushrooms dried whole, or drying the fresh mushrooms and storing them whole. Just keep them in a cool, dry place and out of light as best you can. Once you've done this a couple of times, it's NBD and you can whip it up pretty quick.

Psilocin and -cybin are pretty stable. You could probably trust the tea to stay potent for the next month to maybe 6 weeks? But that's just a guess, at best.

Really, I don't have any good stability data to go on. Not that I wouldn't love to conduct a study...

Dried mushrooms just take a bit longer, because the mushroom bits have to rehydrate before they can start extracting.

Just a thought, but adding the juice would convert psilocybin into psilocin, meaning the mixture would need to be used immedietly as oxygen would degrade the psilocin. So you could potentially freeze ice cubes of the mixture before adding juice, then add the ice cubes into the juice when needed for long term storage. If I'm wrong, correct me.

Citric acid is not strong enough an acid to protonate the benzylic (phenolic?) oxygen and remove the phosphate.

I was just working on a "Lemon Tek is just a sour tea" post. Want to collab?

It's more like unsweetened lemonade.... with Mushrooms. LOL

Its not the pH that you need to look at, it's the pKa if you're talking removing the phosphate to convert to psilocin.

http://www2.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/Database/polyprotic_acids.htm

The pKa of the 1st proton of Citric is not lower than the pKa of any of phosphoric, so you can't add active H+ to phosphates with citric acid.

Not to mention Phenolic oxygens don't behave well for this kind of thing in the first place.



If you were talking about a sweet spot for the acid, the pKa needs to be less than about 3.5 to make an amine acid salt.

You're converting the freebase to Psilocin/-cybin citrate with the lemon juice. It helps (the Psilocin especially) with water solubility.


Interesting. I wonder what is going on in LemonTek trips then.

I know that science isn't exactly about anecdotal evidence. However I do notice a distinct difference in LemonTek trips. Not so much a stronger trip (maybe a little), but more of a faster come-up and smoother comedown. Without the waves of trippiness that can become annoying when you are trying to sleep/relax.

Perhaps the prescribed steep helps one's gastric acid dephosphorylate more quickly by drawing out the actives/making them more bio-available? Any thoughts apart from the obvious placebo?

Also, what could one add to a steep to accomplish what LemonTek is supposed to do? More for comparison than anything else.


Lemon tek helps solubility by making psilocin citrate.
