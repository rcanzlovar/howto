EDIT: I posted about this a few months ago, but because of the many questions and feedback I received, I'd like to include more detailed and specific information using a different example.

I will describe in detail how I generated over $11K in profit with a method that eventually ended up becoming more than a side hustle.

At the time I was still working a 9 to 5 and life was tough. Money was always short at the end of the month, and I had to resort to all sorts of tactics to come up with some extra income to pay the bills. It was exhausting, to say the least.

One day I was exchanging ideas with a guy on how to come up with more money and he taught me a cool trick. In a nutshell, it involves coming up with a very basic design to print on a T-shirt where what you use as the design is given to you by the very own people you are going to sell the shirts to. In other words, people tell you what they would like to see on the design (sort of) and all you do is make a design with that and sell it to them printed on a shirt.

So, how does it work?

You start off by making a simple post on social media. I like to use Facebook for that, because people on there seem to have more time to interact with content. At the time I didn't have a large following, so I created a new Facebook page around a certain profession. You don't have to necessarily do this for a profession, a hobby like fishing or knitting will work equally well. This works for almost every niche (a niche is a group of people who are passionate about a certain topic or interest).

You will understand why it had to be a Facebook page and not my personal profile in a minute. This method works best with people who are passionate about a hobby, profession, or even a life event (pregnancy, engagement, wedding, etc.). I recently did this for one of my niches (drummers), so I'll use that as an example. I'm a drummer myself, so it made sense I went with that. If you need inspiration for choosing a niche, there are various free guides available online.

The post I made on my Facebook page was a very short line of text:

“You know you are a drummer if… (comment below)” OR "Drummers never die, they... (comment below)" etc.

You'll want to find a phrase about anything that characterizes people in that niche. How do you come up with these phrases in the first place? Just search Google images for "Funny NICHE shirts" (e.g. Funny Drummer shirts) and look for any designs that say something about those people in general, like the 2 examples above. You may not find designs like that for every niche, but if you research popular ones like fishing, nurses, cats, etc. I'm sure you'll come across a few that may fit the criteria. The 2 phrases I mentioned above can be adapted to any niche and I'm sure you'll be able to uncover more phrases out there.

That's it. All of this may sound stupid, but if people are really passionate about their profession or hobby, they are going to leave funny comments on your post. If you don't have a large following on social media to leave the post on, you can invest $5 to $10 to promote that post so that it reaches a large audience. If you want to use Facebook ads, boost that post. I did pay around $15 when I did this and that’s why I used a Facebook page. Here's how that works:

Publish the post on your Facebook page Click the "Create ad" button below the image Let AI do the heavy lifting to reach the right audience. Make sure to set your target countries (by default only the country you're in is shown) Set a budget of up to $15 Click Publish This can work equally well on Instagram or any other social network for that matter. But I have only tested it on Facebook.

Wait until you have a large number of comments (I was able to gather over 80 comments with roughly $15 spent on a post boost). If you have a very large page or profile, you don't even have to spend anything on advertising. The goal is to have as many comments as possible, with the least amount of money spent.

What you will see is that some of the comments will get many likes or replies from others who see them. That's an indicator of relevance/popularity. So what you do is copy all those comments and paste them in a spreadsheet and sort them by relevance (number of reactions).

Take the 10 most popular comments and put them aside. You are going to work on them later. If you only have a high number of reactions on one or two comments, use your common sense to pick the remaining 9 or 8 that seem most funny or relevant to you.

Now you are going to make a shirt design using Canva (you can also hire someone on Fiverr). I don’t have many design skills so I hired someone for $5. The design is simply going to be (in my case):

"You know you are a drummer if… (list the most relevant comments you gathered)".

Once you have the design file, you can go to a free website (there are many out there - I could mention some in here, but I'm not sure if that's allowed) and upload it to a simple T-shirt, mug, tote bag, etc. I'll post an image of how the shirt design turned out in the comments.

This is how the whole process works:

These websites let you upload your newly created design files to a product page that is fully developed and ready to go.

You literally only have to upload your design file, choose the product types and price you want to sell the items for, select the color options you want to make available to your customers and create a short description for your products. That’s it. From that moment onwards, you have a beautiful landing page where customers can buy from.

Once a customer lands on the product page and buys an item, the website collects the payment, deducts their product cost and pays you the difference. That’s your profit. They take care of the printing, shipping and customer service for you.

This business model is called print on demand, because the items only get printed after a customer places an order. If you don’t want to use those websites, you can also sell apparel using your own online store. Many sellers also choose marketplaces.

Now you need to promote that shirt. In my case, I used Facebook ads and created a simple sales campaign with a $10 daily spend. 2 ad sets, 1 interest in each, $5/day per ad set. The ad image was a simple mock-up image of the shirt.

Of course there are no guarantees, but I was able to generate 4 sales within the first 24 hours, which allowed me to pay for the first day of advertising, leaving a nice profit for the second and third. And so on. From there things kind of snowballed and I gradually spent more money on advertising, making back more than I was spending. Eventually I reached $22K in sales, of which $5K was ad spend. After subtracting around $6K in product costs, that left me with $11K profit. I stopped there because of diminishing returns at that stage.

I have since replicated this method many times. It's a question of trial and error, there are some hobbies or professions this works well with and others it does not. But then again, it also depends on how much you are willing to invest upfront to gather the initial feedback/comments.

Obviously you can use any other ad platform that works best for you, what I wanted to show you was the method used to sell people products they connect with at an emotional level.

The method I described has been a great way to make a few bucks here and there for the last 11 years and I still use it.

Happy to answer any specific questions in the comments.
