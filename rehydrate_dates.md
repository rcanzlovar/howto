# How to rehydrate dried dates

To rehydrate dried dates, simply soak them in hot water for 10-30 minutes, depending on how soft you want them, or use a microwave steamer pot with water and steam for 1 minute, then check for hydration.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

## Soaking in Hot Water:

* Place the dates in a bowl or measuring cup.
* Cover the dates with boiling water.
* Soak for 10-30 minutes, or until the dates are soft and hydrated.
* Strain the dates and discard the water.

## Microwave Steamer Method:

* Place dates in a microwave steamer pot with a half cup of water.
* Steam for 1 minute in the microwave.
* If further hydration is needed, heat in 30-second increments until dates are soft and hydrated.

## Variations:

* You can use fruit juice or liquor instead of water for extra flavor.
* Soaking dates in brandy, bourbon, or rum can also add flavor.
