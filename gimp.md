# How To Replace A Color In GIMP | The Correct Way â€“ Logos By Nick
To replace one color with another in GIMP, use the "Select by Color" tool, set the new foreground color, and then use the "Fill" tool to apply the new color to the selected area. This method allows you to change all instances of a specific color to your desired new color.

##Detailed Steps:

1. Select by Color:

* Activate the "Select by Color" tool (Tools -> Selection Tools -> By Color Select).
* In the tool options, adjust the threshold if needed for precise selection.
* Click on a pixel of the color you want to replace.
2. Choose New Color:
* Select your desired foreground color using the color picker.

3. Apply the New Color:
* Go to Edit -> Fill -> Fill By Foreground Color (or use the "Fill" tool with the new foreground color selected).

Alternatively, you can use the "Color Exchange" filter:
1. Open Color Exchange: Go to Colors -> Map -> Color Exchange.
2. Choose Colors:
* Select the color you want to replace.
* Select the color you want to replace it with.
3. Apply: Click "OK" to apply the changes.
4. Adjust Settings (Optional):
* Use the Hue/Saturation tool to adjust the color range if necessary.
* Use the "Overlap" slider for fine-tuning the selection accuracy.
