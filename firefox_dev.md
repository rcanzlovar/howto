# how to install developer tools for Firefox on phone 

Although I didn't want this to be a tutorial, I still want to teach you guys how to get these features on your mobile, in case you need them, because sometimes computers are not an option.
Assuming you have a Firefox account download the Firefox For Developer mobile application
##Steps
* Go to settings > About Firefox > Click the Firefox Browser logo 7 times.
* Now you will see Secret Settings, Secret Debug Info, and Custom Add-on Collections.
* Using your regular phone browser, go to your Firefox account using Desktop mode > Add-ons > Collections.
* Create a Collection and name it MyPhone. Once done, you will see a random string of code used as its name. Copy it to your phone clipboard.
* While still on Add-on, go to the Tampermonkey install page, there in the bottom of the page, you will see an option to add it to your collection, do it.
* Go back to Firefox For Developer browser, and in Custom Add-on Collections, add the string of code you copied before in Collection owner(User ID) and MyPhone in Collection name.
* Now on Custom Add-on, you will have Tampermonkey and any browser extension you want to install on your phone by just saving it as your collection for install later.
* As your final step add a custom User-Agent script to Tampermoneky, and you will be ready to use Inspect Element and View Source code.
