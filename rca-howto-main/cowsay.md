# cow



   There are several provided modes which change the appearance of the  cow  depending  on  its  particular  emo‚Äê
       tional/physical state.  The 
       -b option initiates Borg mode; 
       -d causes the cow to appear dead; 
       -g invokes greedy mode;
       -p causes a state of paranoia to come over the cow; 
       -s makes the cow appear thoroughly stoned; 
       -t yields a tired cow; -w is somewhat the opposite of -t, and initiates wired mode; 
       -y brings on the cow's youthful appearance.
