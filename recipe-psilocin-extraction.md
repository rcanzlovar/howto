# psilocin extraction


Items needed

* Citric acid powder
* Ph test strips
* Distilled water
* 2x 250ml flask all glass no plastic on bottle. 
* Magnetic mixer 
* Acetyl Chloride
* Eye dropper tool sorry forgot the proper name
* Beaker funnel and vacuum set up.
* Beaker filter pads
* French press
* Dried mushrooms 

## Step one make psilocin water

Crush up roughly 4g mushroom or blend in spice grinder. Leave mushrooms in grinder. Add 1 cup distilled water to French press. We will then add citric acid to the water. Add 1/8 teaspoon citric acid powder to the water. Using your ph strips test the citric waters ph level. Make sure it’s between 1.5 and 3.5 ph. Then once you have a correct ph. Add your crushed mushrooms to the citric water. Crushed it probably best it will avoid any mushroom particles or most of them. Once the crushed mushrooms are added. Set a 20 min timer. After the time is up. Press down on the French press and pour out the water into your 250ml flask with magnet mixer bead. This water contains the psilocin. This ends the dephosphorylation step. 

## Step 2 acetylation 

Warning ⚠️ Acetyl chloride is a strong acid always where eye mouth and hand protection. Do not get in eyes mouth or on your skin. It is a very reactive chemical please don’t be sloppy. 

Take your psilocin water in your 250ml flask and start mixing on the magnet mixer. Maintain a speed that isn’t splashing but is fast mixing. Then using your glass eye dropper it mush be glass. Suck up about 2.5ml of Acetyl chloride and very slowly add it to the mixing water. A few drops at a time. Allow to mix for 5 min. Solids should start to form after 5 to 10 min. Those solids are the 4-AcO-DMT.

## Step 3 filtering and washing

Filter the water and solids through the beaker filter pump and funnel system. Using stone cold distilled water. Wash off any excess acetylation water. Using a clean stainless steel foot tool break up the product on the filter pad while the product is being vacuumed pulling out excess moisture.

One thing I learned was you should apply a acid scavenger to neutralize the acid. It would be added before you add the Acetyl chloride. Acetyl chloride reacts with water and acids making a off gassing you would need a face mask and eye protection as I said well ventilated. But the proton scavenger is actually also called acid scavenger. It neutralizes the acid in a liquid it’s commonly solid online. You would add a small amount of the acid scavenger to neutralize the PH of the mixture. Then add Acetyl chloride to mixture for the acetylation process of making a stable form of psilocin 4acodmt.
