# Prayers Attributed to Dr. John Dee
John Dee's Daily Oration for Wisdom from The First Book ofthe Mysteriesi


Before my other extemporaneous prayers and more ardent ejaculations to God: 
This one was the most usual.

## My Morning and Evening Oration: for Wisdom.

In the Name of God the Father, of God the Son, and of God the Holy Spirit. Amen. 

Almighty, Everlasting, True and Living God stretch forth,now, to my help:Lord of 
Lords, King of Kings, Jehovah Lord of Hosts, hastento my assistance. Glory to God, 
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: As it was in the beginning, and is now, and will be 
always, even unto the Age of Ages: Amen.

Teach me to properly sense, and to rightly discern, (O Father of all things,) 
For I desire your Wisdom, because it is
all that is: Give your word to my established practice,(O 
Father of all things,) and fix your wisdom in my heart. O Lord Jesus 
Christ (who art the true wisdom, of your
eternal, and Omnipotent Father) Most humbly I entreat your
Divine Majesty, that you might think myself worthy, in respect of my 
general piety, to promptly send forth your
Wise and tested Philosophical assistance, to that fulfillment
of understanding and perfection, that will be of the greatest
value towards the enlarging of my praising and glorification
onto you. And when no one is subject to Death, and at last
there is Life in the Earth, to which office is it that I will have
been fitted: In particular to whom, according to your eternal
foresight, will your beneficent eminence have assigned me:
Moreover, truly and most humbly it is my most burning and
most steadfast quest to your Divine Majesty, that you would
think worthy to send forth from heaven to me, your good
Spiritual Ministers and Angels, Namely Michael, Gabriel,
Raphael, and even Uriel: and (in accordance with your
Heavenly favor ) as often so ever as any other of your true
and faithful Angels, who might completely and perfectly
inform and furnish me, in the true and accurate, knowledge
and understanding of your Secret Mysteries and Mighty

Works (Concerning the properties of all of your Creatures
and the best use of those natures) and of the unavoidable
necessity for the Decree of our Deaths; to the praising,
honoring, and glorification of your name; and to confirm to
me, and of others (through me) of your many faithful
encouragements: and to the disorder and ruin of your
enemies. Amen.

Let the Will of Jehovah Zebaoth be done: Let the Will of Adonai be done, let the will of Elohim be done, O Blessed
and Most Beneficent Almighty Trinity, yield to me (John Dee)
this request, for such a method, whereby to most appeaseyou. Amen.
14
Since the year 1579. in general by this mode;
It has been most pleasing to me to pour forth prayers to
God; Either in the Latin language or in the English
(moreover since around the year 1579 by a particularly
strange and different method: sometimes for Raphael;
occasionally for Michael)
19
Let God, his own mercy, beglorious in me. Amen.

Prayer of John Dee

O Almighty, Eternal, the True and Living God: O King of
Glory: O Lord of Hosts: O thou, the Creator of Heaven, and
Earth, and of all things visible and invisible: Now, (even
now, at length,) Among others thy manifold mercies used,
toward me, thy simple servant John Dee, I most humbly
beseech thee, in this my present petition to have mercy
upon me, to have pity upon me, to have Compassion upon
me: Who, faithfully and sincerely, of long time, have sought
among men, in Earth: And also by prayer, (full often and
pitifully,) have made suit unto thy Divine Majesty for the
obtaining of some convenient portion of True Knowledge and
understanding of thy laws and Ordinances, established in the
Natures and properties of thy Creatures: by which
Knowledge, Thy Divine Wisdom, Power and Goodness, (on
thy Creatures bestowed, and to them imparted.) being to
me made manifest, might abundantly instruct, furnish, and
allure me, (for the same,) incessantly to pronounce thy praises, 
to rend unto thee, most hearty thanks, to advance
thy true honor, and to Win unto thy Name, some of thy due
Majestical Glory, among all people, and forever."
