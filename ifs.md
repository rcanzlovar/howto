I thought [this interview] (https://www.tenpercent.com/tph/podcast-episode/richard-schwartz-323) with Dan Harris and Richard Schwartz (the "founder" of IFS) was a pretty good intro.

Honestly though, anyone who's actually interested should just take the time to read through 
No Bad Parts, which Richard Schwartz 
wrote. It's a good overview of the whole practice, I found it well worth the audible credit.

FWIW I found the following playlist helpful: https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8KCPMHp-qUs2VRKDMTpVTOoc1WLAHGlV

… prior to this I had tried to read a highly recommended book ( https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/0984392777?psc=1 ), but in that book I found IFS seemed “hokey”. The video helped explain the bits that I didn’t understand in the book.

To be clear: I’m not blaming the book, I’m just saying that I had a hard time understanding things from that book alone 🙂

My psychedelic assisted therapy certification program (Innatepath.org) specifically mixes ifs and psychedelics (plus a couple other modalities)

To each their own, but I didn’t find IFS particularly helpful. IFS felt like an elaborate metaphor to represent the idea of intrapsychic conflict (an idea dating back to Freud). It’s just a clunky repackaging of old therapy techniques.

CBT has been much more helpful to me in a direct, no nonsense style.

Just my 2 cents/experience. If people find IFS helpful, go for it, but I personally didn’t like it.

It’s so important to find what works. Each person is different.

Out of curiosity, was this therapist able to help guide you to be able to successfully unblend with parts so you could then work with them?

Absolutely - people should do whatever works for them.

Honestly, I only stuck with it for 2 or 3 sessions. I found language like “unblend with parts of yourself” to be a little silly and overly abstract. My next therapy was CBT based and I found that much more helpful. I defined my issues in behavioral terms and then made behavior changes accordingly.

Ahh yes. The word “unblending” can be confusing at first but a good therapist will be able to explain it clearly. It’s synonymous with the word disidentification, which is what occurs at higher psychedelic doses. It’s where a lot of the therapeutic aspect of psychs comes from. It involves the capacity to look at yourself, your emotions, your thoughts, etc, in an objective, non-identified way.
