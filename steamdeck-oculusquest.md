# use immersed to give you desktop on steam deck from oculus.

I got this to work:

Download the app "immersed" from meta store in the quest head set and launched it.

In Desktop mode on the steam deck, download the immersed app launcher from the site listed in the headset using firefox. I think the website is like immersed.com/setup... something like that.

When you run the app on the steam deck, a little orange icon will pop up on the bottom of the screen. You click on it if a new small window doesn't pop up. The window will ask you to verify the code in your headset, and the username in the headset.

From there the steam deck and your quest 2 will sync and the immersed app will launch a tutorial on how to use it. Then you just chill and play your steam deck games on as big a screen as you want. I'd say this was a super easy way to get this done. The only downside is that you have to launch all your games from desktop mode, but that isn't really that bad. In the apps options menu that opens in the quest 2 app I turned down super sampling to zero and got a really clear picture.
