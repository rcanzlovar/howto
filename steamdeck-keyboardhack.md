# keyboard hack

I spent 2 days making a keyboard & mouse configuration for the SD trackpads. 
I hope you like it and share any feedback.

Chrome configuration name: Trackpads M&K - By Nicotor. Link: workshop://2873491386

Launch Chrome in the normal game mode, press the steam button and 
click on control configuration. 
Then click on the profile and then press the top bumper buttons to change 
the local library of templates to the community library and then search that 
list for the title: trackpads M&K - by Nicotor. Cheers!
