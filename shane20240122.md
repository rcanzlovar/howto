Oh, Sara has that card. It's old but you should still be able to infer with a smaller model. Describe a little more what you were wanting to do first. You can get a feel for what it's like messing with open source models, and then branch out to understand what's going to be best for your purposes.
Edited7:35 PM

What's your reasoning behind favoring Facebook to Signal btw?
7:37 PM

Wqs easier to copy paste the stuff from my mail 
7:39 PM

Is it a desktop vs phone thing?
Edited7:39 PM

I just ask because for a period there anyway nobody seemed to know that there is a desktop app for Signal.
7:40 PM

Thaf and on signal I have basically 2 friends. You and John 

Facebook is the only way I know what's happening with basically anyone in my family 
7:41 PM

Well, I'm sure end-to-end encryption will eventually be made illegal anyway. ðŸ˜„
I even just now started to rabbit hole and had to stop myself mid-comment reply to dig back out.
7:42 PM

Lol it was a long time that signal was strictly my "Shane is talking to me" app. Then 2 years ago WD got hacked and they decided that since we couldn't trust teams and outlook and all that. Suddenly it was going off at all hours of the day and might as people on my team reformed on signal 

I was pissed
7:52 PM

Hehe. Did you eventually learn the "mute" functionality?
7:54 PM

Lol it comes and goes. Mute light as well be "do I have a phone?"

Not so much the alerts but that they had just decided my phone was their phone 

I don't allow work on my phone if I can help it 
8:10 PM

Ahhh. Yeah totally understood.
8:10 PM

Lately it's where I peek at fb or  reddit at work. I don't go to those sites from my current work 

Oh so I stopped at Mark 's place in the way home

I had it pegged correctly, he was being fired 

And they screwed him out of his sick days 
8:12 PM

Bleh, that's super lame.
8:12 PM

This is the best trump I've seen https://youtu.be/uKkQS9RoKKo

Have you Shane Gillis's?

This is cute but Shane's is spot on.
8:36 PM

I just read about how badly 45's ratings tanked because people didn't watch the inauguration 

I had two TVs on other things. And Nielsen watches my house 
8:37 PM

Heh

But those millions of people who were there in person!

Here's an example of practical usage of machine learning, with Gemini 2.0:
Thank you for providing the HTML snippet and the file tree information. This gives me a much clearer understanding of the data structure.

Here are my initial observations and how we can use them to guide the parsing process:

Observations from the HTML Snippet:

Overall Structure: The HTML is relatively straightforward and uses semantic class names that suggest a consistent structure across different conversation files.
Conversation Container: The main container for each conversation seems to be a <div> with the classes _li, _a705, or _ikh depending on whether it is a thread, user, or group chat respectively.
Message Block: Each individual message appears to be within a <div> with class _a6-g.
Sender: The sender of... Read more

They're also handy for going through, e.g., TOSes and dense arxiv papers.

That doesn't quite capture the code block markup of its own.

But you can also just shoot the shit with mankind's collective knowledge and have them tutor you on all sorts of things. They act especially fond of tutoring on the intricacies of LLMs.
8:42 PM

I guess you're looking at questions on open source ones not just any, though. I'm just in the middle of my project with Gemini and might've overlooked that you're already familiar and just looking for local recommendations.

You

But you didn't respond to this I realize.
8:49 PM

Yeah I've played with chatgpt a bit

We were composing a story about the PINO
8:50 PM

Ah yes, the evil empire of Microsoft OpenAI.

ðŸ˜œ
The only reason nobody has called "AGI" yet is because Microsoft's non-compete clause with OpenAI ends as soon as poorly-defined "AGI" is reached.

And Microsoft's machine learning dept CEO is now the original CEO of DeepMind.

Google's new Titans transformer architecture that started getting talked about during the weekend is a bit unsettling.
Edited8:53 PM

But I once again digress. I'm used to being able to fork conversations for my tangential thinking.

Check out https://huggingface.co/bartowski for quantizations (lowered bit-density computations, saves tons of VRAM space and down to 4-bit IQ4_XXS to Q4_K_L you're not actually losing much.
8:56 PM

I wish I had all this stuff on something other than my phone 

That really is the biggest drawback to signal for me 
9:00 PM

Like for a standard Meta Llama 3.1 8B (8 billion parameters, different from tokens...I think the 8B is trained on 1 trillion or 2 tokens from which the training built 6 billion weights or "meanings") you could fit a Q4_K_M with a good-sized context window.

9:00 PM

I just want to get started. All of the options. It's like a firehose 
9:00 PM

Right? It's daunting even after a year+ of playing with them, especially for a file-collector type like I am.

Recommendation for easiest start: go to http://ollama.ai and download the host service. You can also just pull directly from the site and get usually 4-bit quantizations. Really that bartowski is most useful when you want something more specific as far as VRAM usage.

Gemma-2 is a Google/DeepMind model that is fun to work with and extremely creative.
9:04 PM

Shit speaking of file collector . My nas is down hopefully just a power supply but I realized I accidentally wiped my projects directory 
9:04 PM

Oh shit, that sounds bad.
9:04 PM

It kind of is 
9:05 PM

I hope you can get that back and get on Dropbox or something.
9:05 PM

If the nas comes back I think I have an old version on it 
9:05 PM

Dropbox is $20/mo for 3TB data and I think some automatic encryption if you set it up. Google Drive is a little cheaper but then you're open to Gemini just poking around in your files without permission.
9:06 PM

But Ive decided I'm not buying anything else from bezos
9:06 PM

I thought it was hilarious when I heard a Zoomer say "I'm not shopping from Amazon because they're evil. I shop at Walmart."
9:07 PM

Man... I was in a tear Sunday night . Decided to take some mushroom tea 
9:07 PM

Ooh fun.
9:07 PM

I have a weird habit of taking shrooms just before or after something terrible happens

Marie and I took some the night after the Israel Palestine thing started . I wasn't much fun 

I kind of traumatized her 

I'm glad the ratings thing worked

I watched dune 2 while it was happening..you know. Touching tale desert "rats" taking down a fat fucker who thinks highly of himself 

I'm thinking that Micron might be a good place to be right now 

The China connection is actually a plus 

And they are supposed to be set to do well with AI 

Did you read the job description I sent?

The mobo ony Linux system has 4 slots that could take a GPU

I didn't get to the craziest part of the thing with Mark 
56m

Oh I missed that before.

Go on.
56m

He's offering me half of his house in return for me depending some $10-20k getting things fixed 

Spendinf
55m

Oh nice!

Way to be social. :)
55m

Zillow said it's worth 413k
55m

Sweet!
54m

I'm confronted by the investment. He seems to think I should move in but I don't want to leave Joe in a lurch... Besides I'm not sure I want to live with him 

But he did mention what what if someone offered him a good deal... So it might be a shorter term thing
52m

That'd be a good one.
52m

It's way too much house for him alone 

He's been there since the 90s

He was a little taken aback when he saw my mess 
51m

Even my middling Denver house was way more than I needed, and 840sqft is still more than I need. I don't even use the front "living room" area.
51m

But I'm thinking of planting a garden in his back yard 
51m

Heh, I know what that's like.
50m

I'm borderline hoarder these days 
50m

I look a little like that rn but it's largely because recycling only picks up every two weeks and I missed it twice in a row.

I'm not well socialized either, what with my primary conversational partners being synthetic.

It had me do 3.9 but what is the difference between auro and manual 
36m

Good question. No idea.

Last time I installed python it was 3.12 through the Windows Store of all things.

I just had to start somewhere since I couldn't find a good binary for pip.

Heh I run 96GB now and can fill it up when doing image generation.

She was using it for her 2nd life . She is legally blind so was using a 65" TV as her monitor. That's coming over this weekend

At work I have the same setup but with a bigger middle that was a TV 

Like a 42 inch with the standard two everyone else has as the portraits 

I had the same setup last time I was there. About my third day I asked the PC guy if he had any TVs laying around he did 

I sometimes have my steam deck attached to the big Roku in front of the couch. There are three big screen setups in my living room 

I have a silly amount of competition

I told you about when Soltahr dumped me. She was freaked out by ally tech when she told to leave it was "and take all your electronics with you"

26m

Pytorch done,hugging face next 

It suggested I use dialogpt instead of llama 7b . Am I gonna end up with all of the things?
22m

LLaVA is strictly for image describing. It's interesting tho. And if you get into the image diffusion side it's also useful in some kinds of workflows.

Give dialogpt a try. Again, gemma-2 is worth checking out. Llama 3.1 or above. Lessee...

Oh yeah, Dolphin 3.0 Lllama 3.1 8B is the "uncensored" Llama 3.1, in that the censoring part has been "ablated" and then further de-aligning stuff done to it. They say on their model card, "Treat it as you would a gun or a knife."

Hyperbolic but funny.

I'm in a dependency hell trying to get signal installed

No idea on Linux.

Do you know to use virtual environments with python?

I started all the python stuff from scratch learning open source, but dependency hell is something that certainly has happened to me a lot.

DialoGPT is ancient btw. GPT2 is so 2022-23.

I grabbed the whole thing since I didn't have any history before this conversation for the same reason.
