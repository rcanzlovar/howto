# Sgotch egg recope


Anyway, tonight i had a 2am craving for something savoury. I scoured the fridge and realised i had everything required to make my own scotch eggs from scratch...... and cheap.... Naturally, I stormed into action. Here's what I have used and the cost breakdown.
- 6 eggs. Pack of 12 XL barn laid cost $4.99 Aldi (cost $2.50)
- 8 Herb and garlic sausages $5.99 Aldi 
- 1/3 bag of bread crumbs (already had these but I'll say cost is $1.00)
- 1 cup of flour (say about $0.50)
- 100ml Milk ($4.45 for 3L Aldi, cost $0.15)
- 750ml Extra Virgin olive oil (which i will strain and reuse, recouping about 90% essentially costing around $1.40 in oil loss)
Not considering labour cost or gas cost for the stove use (I love food, I'm a hobby chef and I don't consider cooking to be a chore) the over all cost was $11.54 making them $2.89 each.


I made 4 massive scotch eggs all up, 2 eggs were used for egg wash.
Not only did they taste better but they were much larger then the ones the local shops sold. Overall I am very pleased with my first (but definitely not my last) time making scotch eggs. Serve up with some tomato sauce and you are in savoury heaven.
