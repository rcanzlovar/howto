My daughter and I had just finished a salad at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas, and we decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the"Neiman-Marcus cookie." It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe, and the waitress said with a small frown, "I’m afraid not, but you can buy the recipe." Well, I asked how much, and she responded, "Only two fifty-it’s a great deal!" I agreed to that, and told her to just add it to my tab. 
Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement, and the Neiman-Marcus charge was 
$285.00! I looked again, and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two 
salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, 
it said, "Cookie Recipe-$250.00". That was outrageous! 
I called Neiman’s Accounting Department and told them the waitress said it 
was "two fifty", which clearly does not mean "two hundred and fifty dollars" by 
any reasonable interpretation of the phrase. Neiman-Marcus refused to budge. 
They would not refund my money because, according to them, "What the waitress 
told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe. We absolutely 
will not refund your money at this point." I explained to the Accounting Department lady 
the criminal statutes which govern fraud in the state of Texas. I threatened to report them 
to the Better Business Bureau and the Texas Attorney General’s office for engaging in 
fraud. I was basically told, "Do what you want. Don’t bother thinking of how you can get 
even, and don’t bother trying to get any of your money back." 
I just said, Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I’m going to have $250 worth of 
fun." I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the United 
States with an e-mail account has a $250 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus...for free. 
She replied, "I wish you wouldn’t do this." I said, "Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you ripped me off!" and slammed down the phone. So here it is! 
Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of. I 
paid $250 for this, and I don’t want Neiman-Marcus to EVER make another penny off of this recipe!
