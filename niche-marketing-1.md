You don't say what your poison of choice is, but many have a hard time with carts. If  you can switch yourself off to something else like flower, maybe it's easier to quit that. 

➡️ Step 1: CHOOSE YOUR NICHE
I know you see everyone talking about this, but it’s true. This is the most important step and it HAS to be something that interests you!

➡️ Step 2: Make a fresh social media account
- I recommend Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, or blogging
(Don’t use your personal account. Do you really wanna promote products to your friends &amp; family?🤢

➡️ Step 3: Set up your sales funnel
I use our mentorship program for this, check my biò Iink 🥰

This will allow you to direct your viewers to whatever Iinks you’re wanting them to see 

➡️ Step 4: Make your email auto responder
I use Aweber: this is what allows the passive incóme. This is where you’ll promóte however many products you’d like, and you can set it up so it sends the email out whenever you want

➡️ Step 5: Choose your lead magnet
This provides your viewer the incentive to hand over their email! Offer a frée product that you know they want!)

➡️ Step 6: Choose the products you want to promóte
Here are affiIiate websites to find products
Clickbank.com
ShareASale.com
Digistore24.com
CJ affiliates

➡️ Step 7: Start posting &amp; directing your viewers to your Iinks!
Post entertaining and educational content about your niche/product 1-5 times a day so you can develop stats around what works!
