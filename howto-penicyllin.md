# How to make Penicyllin

The strains that we have are from the mold grown on a cantaloupe in the 1940s, so you can grab some cantaloupe 
if you're feeling like a traditionalist. Otherwise, a leftover crust of bread or the peel of some citrus fruit 
will do fine. The mold will start out gray, but as it develops will turn a bright blue-green. Once it gets 
started, cut the bread up into pieces and put it in a sterilized flask. (You can sterilize a flask by putting 
it in an oven at 315 degrees for an hour.) Incubate it in the flask for about a week at around seventy degrees.

you can extract the penicillin by sterilizing yet another jar and, according to the experts, adding the following:


Into 
500ml of cold tap water 
put:
* 44.0 grams Lactose Monohydrate, 
* 25.0 grams cornstarch, 
* 3.0 grams sodium nitrate, 
* 0.25 grams magnesium sulfate, 
* 0.50 grams potassium phosphate mono, 
* 2.75 grams glucose monohydrate, 
* 0.044 grams zinc sulfate, 
* 0.044 grams manganese sulfate. 

Then add enough cold tap water to make one liter. 
Use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to between 5.0 and 5.5.

Then you add the spores from the moldy bread. Another seven days incubation will leave the penicillin floating 
in the liquid portion of the results. A quick filter and you have penicillin.

## Urgent Medical Disclaimer!

In theory, at least, you have penicillin. I must stress at this point that you should not use this homemade 
penicillin on any limb that you want to keep. Although you did probably get a lot of penicillium mold growing 
on the bread, you also got other molds. Even with the right kind of fungi growing, filtering out everything 
but the penicillin is difficult, and best left to the professionals. Molds make a lot of different things to 
kill bacteria, and many of them are harmful to humans. While there are plenty of survivalist websites that 
recommend clapping whatever grows on bread or citrus to your wound, and while that might even be an option 
sometimes after the world ends, there are better options right now, and you should take advantage of them. 
If you want to see how well you've done making penicillin, try growing a tray of bacteria and using the 
penicillin on that.
