In 2020, I bought a second-hand iPod nano from eBay. 
Upon its arrival, I charged it up with the provided lead and decided to test the functionality of this MP3 player that had probably been used for the first time a decade before I'd purchased it. 
To my delight, it worked perfectly adequately.
But, moreover, I discovered that the previous owner - who, according to the device, was called Mick - had left 21 songs on there.
Here are all the songs in alphabetical order, by title:
1. Angie (2009 Remaster) - The Rolling Stones
2. Another Brick in the Wall - Pink Floyd
3. Band of Gold - Freda Payne
4. Because the Night - Patti Smith
5. Born to Run - Bruce Springsteen 
6. Cool For Cats - Squeeze
7. Dance With the Devil - Cozy Powell 
8. Dangerous Rhythm - Ultravox
9. Fanfare for the Common Man - Emerson, Lake & Palmer
10. Germ Free Adolescents - X-Ray Spex
11. Get It On - T. Rex
12. Hanging On The Telephone (2001 Remaster) - Blondie
13. Heart of Glass - Blondie
14. Hocus Pocus World Cup 2010 - Focus
15. The Jean Genie - David Bowie 
16. Life's a Gas - T. Rex
17. London Calling (Remastered) - The Clash
18. Ride A White Swan - T. Rex
19. Sylvia - Focus
20. Tainted Love - Soft Cell
21. The Wild, The Beautiful & The Damned - Ultravox
F26, UK, feels too guilty to remove any songs from an 8GB iPod bought from a stranger four years ago.
