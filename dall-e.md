Struggling with Text on logos with GPT4 & Dalle-3?
Here are some Top Tips to Improve the Accuracy of Text Generation with DALL-E 3
Dalle-3 struggles when it comes to text generation which can be frustrating when trying to make logos for example. Over 300 tests (admittedly more robust research will need to be done) were done and this is what was found:
Putting the word that you want it to generate at the front of the prompt, rather than at the back. For example, “The name **‘Skyline Tech’** integrated into a logo with a futuristic city skyline” instead of “A logo with a futuristic city skyline, with the name ‘Skyline Tech’ integrated”. - Improved correct spelling from 19/60 to 24/60
Repeating the word that you want it to generate twice, once at the front and once at the back of the prompt. For example, use “The name ‘**Skyline Tech’** integrated into a logo with a futuristic city skyline, with the name ‘**Skyline Tech’** integrated” instead of “The name ‘Skyline Tech’ integrated into a logo with a futuristic city skyline”.  Improved correct spelling from 26/60 to 30/60
Writing the word that you want it to generate using capital letters. For example, use “The name **‘SKYLINE TECH’** integrated into a logo with a futuristic city skyline, with the name **‘SKYLINE TECH’** integrated” instead of “The name ‘Skyline Tech’ integrated into a logo with a futuristic city skyline, with the name ‘Skyline Tech’ integrated”. -
Overall when combining all winning approached (capital letters repeating the word twice within the prompt) improved text accuracy by 87% when compared to just using the text one at the end of the prompt 19/60 vs  104/180)
