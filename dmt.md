# directions for making dmt




It would seem my full tek is too long for a comment.

To summarize -

200g NaOH in 1500 mL water cooled to room temp.

Add 200g shredded MHRB. Allow to react for like 10 min.

Add 300 mL naphtha.

Whisk then allow to separate every so often for 24 hr. Room temp.

Freeze precipitate.

Super simple.
 
He used spiritveghead’s tek, but modified it for 200 gram extraction instead of 100. If you’re going to do this, I would recommend splitting up your extraction vessels when you scale up. Volume and surface area do not scale proportionally, thus one big extraction may take more time depending on the extraction vessel.

I recently did a 300 gram extraction split between 6 mason jars and found that to be excellent for maximizing yield.
