## Extraction: 
Samples (0.01 0 0.1 g of dried ground mushrooms were extracred with 5 t0 10 ml 
of methanol from 0.5 to 12 hours by using a magnetic stirrer at room temerature. 
Under equal conditions the mixtures with aqueous acetic acid and acetic acid 
(casale 1985) and aqueous ethanol (psilocin) and methanol (psilocybin)(LYSUKLA AND WURST,
WURST et al 1992) were usued for extraction.of the same batch of mushrooms. 
In the cases wiuth aqueous alcohols as solvent a differnet extraction time for 
psilocybin(
