# Blu’s Gummy recipe and Tea Tek


## Gummy Ingredients 

* 8 ounces weighed mushroom tea water (cold or room temperature)
* 60 grams gelatin powder ( 7.5g gelatin per every ounce of water)
* 8 ounces sugar
* 8 ounces of syrup (corn, agave, or whatever syrup you like even maple)
* 3 tablespoons sorbitol
* 2 teaspoons lemon tek (optional)

## Tea Tek

Ingredients 

* 14 ounces distilled water
* 1 small lemon
* 50 to 60 grams dried mushrooms 
* French Press 

Start by breaking up your dried mushrooms by hand into small pieces, and place them into your French press. DO NOT blend into powder. In a small pot add 14 ounces of water and bring that to a boil. Once at a boil turn of the stove and take the pot of water off the stove. Let the water stop boiling and add the hot water to the mushrooms in the French press. Then using a small slice of lemon add a few drops of lemon juice to the mushroom tea. Do not add a lot of lemon juice only a few drops is needed. Then using a butter knife or stir stick mix the mushrooms in the water. Get a good agitation going for a minute. Then add the top of the French press. Do not fully press. You want the mushrooms to be pressed just enough to were its below the water line. That allows the tea to steep correctly. If you press your tea fully you won’t get a good extraction. Allow your tea to brew for 12 hours. 
After 12 hours you can now fully press the French press and pour out your mushroom tea extract. If using psilocybin mushrooms your tea should be blue in color. If it’s darker yellow that it fine that tends to happen if the water is to hot when you add like a hard boil or the mushrooms where broken up to fine. If Amanita muscaria was used tea should be a gold to red color. WARNING ⚠️ the tea extract is very very strong. Don’t not consume tea concentrate. 
Weigh your tea if 60 grams of mushrooms was used you should have roughly 8 to 10 ounces of tea. If 50 grams of mushrooms was used you will be left with 10 ounces of water.
Gummy bear recipe 

Start by weighing your mushroom tea water. Depending on the weight of the tea water will tell you how much gelatin you are going to need. Gelatin to tea ratio is 7.5 grams of gelatin to every 1 ounce of tea water. Do not use more than 10 ounces of tea water for the gummy recipe. If you have to much tea water you will need to reduce it. I will post later how to do that. Back to gummy making. 

Add your weighed gelatin to a glass bowl. Then add your cold tea water to the gelatin. Mix gelatin and tea well using a whisk. You don’t want gelatin clumps. Allow your tea and gelatin to bloom for 10 min. 

Then after 10 min. Start melting your sugar and syrup. Using a stainless steel pot bring your sugar, syrup, and sorbitol to a boil. Make sure your sugar is fully melted. You can mix the melted sugar with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is melted. Once sugar is melted and reaches a boil. Take it off the heat. Using a thermometer make sure melted sugar is below 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Melted sugar is below 200f between 190f and 200f. Add melted sugar to gelatin mix using a whisk. Break up gelatin, mix well no lumps or gummies will come out lumpy. Once fully mixed with no lumps let mixture sit for 5 minutes. Using a spoon scrape the foam that forms off the top of the mixture. Do your best to get all the foam off. Makes for better looking gummies. Some people leave to foam. Then pour the melted gummy mixture into a clean French press and pour into molds. Recipe makes roughly 32 to 36 square gummy’s. Place gummies in freezer for 30 minutes. Then move to fridge. Gummy’s will set in 3 hours. Then remove gummy’s from there molds. Place them on parchment paper. Then using a small fan have them cure in the open air with the fan on them. The fan will dry the outside. After 12 hours flip and allow the other side to dry. Then store appropriately. Gummy’s can last outside of the fridge for a few weeks. But will last 6 months or more in a fridge.


I also have a acetylation tek to make solid state psilocin/psilocybe 4Aco Dmt. I can post that one as well if you all want
