Your 14-day Blueprint:



Day 1:
- Research high-paying affiliate marketing niches.
- Choose your niche &amp; define your target audience. (ex. Fitness: busy moms or women over 30).
- Research affiliate programs in your niche &amp; choose one
- Get your affiliate links.

Days 2-3:
- Set up a new Instagram account.
- Craft a compelling profile (use terms related to your target audience) and put your affiliate link in your bio.
- Plan your first 3 posts. (You can do a faceless or personal brand account, or re-post existing videos.)
- Film 1-3 high-quality reels introducing your niche.
- Schedule your posts for specific dates!

Days 4-12:
- Post 1-2 reels per day with actionable tips, your “why”, or pain points/deep desires of your audience.
- Add a Call To Action (ex: “Follow for more fitness-on-a-tight-schedule tips”).
- Post 2-5 stories per day.

Days 13-14:
- Reflect on your progress, what worked well, &amp; what needs improvement.
- Plan content &amp; strategies for the upcoming month based on your analysis.
- Rinse &amp; repeat!

From there:
- Automate DM conversations to close sales on autopilot (use ManyChat)
- Scale to $20k-100k per month with high-ticket products or with additional accounts/niches.
