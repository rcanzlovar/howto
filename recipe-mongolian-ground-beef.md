Mongolian Ground Beef Noodles
Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup beef broth
1/3 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Pinch of red pepper flake (optional for a spicy kick)
10 oz linguine
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
4 green onions, sliced for garnish

Directions:
Cook the Pasta: Begin by cooking the linguine according to the package instructions in a large pot of boiling water. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.
Brown the Ground Beef: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef until itâ€™s no longer pink. Drain any excess fat as needed.
Add Aromatics and Sauces: Add the minced garlic to the browned beef and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Then, add the soy sauce, beef broth, brown sugar, hoisin sauce, ground ginger, black pepper, and red pepper flake. Stir to combine.
Thicken the Sauce: Mix cornstarch with cold water until smooth and stir into the skillet. Bring to a gentle boil; the sauce will thicken.
Combine with Noodles: Toss the cooked noodles in the skillet, ensuring they are fully coated with the sauce. Allow to simmer together for 2-3 minutes.
Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle sliced green onions over the noodles and serve hot
