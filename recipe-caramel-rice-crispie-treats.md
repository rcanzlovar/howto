# Salted Caramel Rice Krispie Treats

Salted Caramel Rice Krispie Treats

Gourmet Salted Caramel Crispy Bars
## Ingredients:
• 4 1/2 cups mini marshmallows
• 3 tablespoons butter
• 6 cups Rice Krispies cereal
• 11 ounces Kraft caramels, unwrapped
• 2 tablespoons milk
• Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling

## Directions:
1. Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with non-stick cooking spray and set it aside.
2. In a big microwave-safe bowl, put the butter and marshmallows together. Pop it in the microwave on high for about 1 minute and 15 seconds until the marshmallows are all melty and puffy. Stir it until it's all smooth.
3. Mix up the melted marshmallows with the Rice Krispies cereal in another big bowl. Press that mix nice and even into your prepared dish.
4. Now, in a medium microwave-safe bowl, toss in the caramels and milk. Microwave that on high for 1 minute and 20 seconds. Give it a good stir until it's super smooth, heating it up in 10-second bursts if you need to.
5. Pour that luscious caramel sauce all over your Rice Krispies treats. Sprinkle some of that coarse sea salt on top.
6. Let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes to set, then cut it into 16 bars and dig in!
