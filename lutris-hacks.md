installed wine
installed q4wine
installed lutris
indstalled 

Open Lutris, select 

lutris asks for installation directory - this is where it will run from
Next select the SETUP.EXE or whatever to install it. 
During the installation it asked  if i wanted to install QuickTime. I said yes. but 
When I tried to run it, it says it couldn't find quicktime. The solution turned out
to be that i needed to copy the files from c_drive/QTW/BIN/* to c_drive/FREAKS/

Once i did this, it got into the game. The game crashed a few seconds later, said 
something about turning off memory caching in the settings. 

still need to get sound to work as well.
